## Abstract

This study examines the Bayesian spatio-temporal methods to analyze local
patterns of housing rate over time at the county level by an application to
the housing data in the state of Connecticut, United States.

The method used in this paper was proposed by Napier, Lee, and Robertson 
(2016) in the paper *A Model to Estimate the Impact of Changes in MMR *
*Vaccination Uptake on Inequalities in Measles Susceptibility in Scotland* 
where they explored the Bayesian spatio-temporal method to study epidemiological
questions about vaccination rates in Scotland. In this paper, the
Bayesian model was extended to monitor the spatio-temporal change of CT housing 
rate and it estimated (1) overall temporal trend, and (2) area-specific 
differential trend.

## Introduction

### Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Approaches 

As spatio-temporal data has become increasingly popular, a comprehensive 
statstical understanding of this data is meaningful.  And considering both
the spatial effects and temporal effects simultaneously renders richer 
information from the data and thus forms a bigger, clearer, and more interesting
picture for data.

Currently there are many statistical models available for capturing the 
spatio-temporal pattern, and in this study, Bayesian spatio-temporal methods
are applied. The methods are hierarchical and utilize parameters which
follow certain probability distributions, which are specified 
by some prior believes or knowledge.  For instance, neighborhood information or
other known information can be included in the models to provide a better 
representation of the autocorrelation among all spatial units.  Moreover, 
the posterior probability can render an idea of whether a parameter value 
exceeds certain threshold.  As a result, the Bayesian methods take a full 
advantage of all the available information, provide a more meaningful 
representation of parameters, and return more useful results. Moreover, 
Bayesian methods are favored because they stabilize the area-specific risks 
as they can borrow strength of neighborhood areas. 

### Datasets

The primary dataset is given and maintained by the Office of Policy and 
Management, State of Connecticut. It lists all real estate sales with a sales 
price of $2,000 or greater that occur between October 1 and September 30 of 
each year. For each sale record, the file includes: town, property address, 
date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or
vacant land), sales price, and property assessment. Number of sale records by 
year for each county can be aggregated by this dataset.

The additional dataset is the annual housing inventory data by town provided by 
the Department of Economic and Community Development.  This dataset has the 
housing inventory from 2000 to 2017 based on census 2000 and 2010 data.  Number
of properties by year for each county can be obtained from this dataset.

The average sales rate for county in each year is then calculated 
as $$\frac{\text{number of sale records}}{\text{number of properties}}$$

### Analysis Tool

`CARBayesST` is an `R` package developed by Duncan Lee, Alastair Rushworth, and 
Gary Napier. It provides multiple models for spatial data relating to 
non-overlapping areal units, and this package stands out as it includes models 
that explore the overall spatial-temporal trend with different focuses.  Many 
of the models utilize the conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors to 
capture the spatial auto-correlation in the data, and depending on the nature 
of the data, the users can select certain models to fulfill their needs.  
Furthermore, in all the cases the inference in this software is based on Markov 
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) stimulation which is used in the following proposed 
method.  Hence, this package is selected to conduct Bayesian analysis in this 
study.


## Proposed Method

The study region is first divided as $k = 1,{\dots}, K$ non-overlapping areal 
units, and data are recorded for each unit for $t = 1,{\dots}, N$ time periods.  
For this study, $N = 16$ and $K = 8$ because the primary dataset has sales 
records from 2011 to 2016 for all 8 counties in Connecticut.  Thus, $Y_{kt}$, 
the response variable, is the number of observed housing sales records.  
It is assumed that $Y_{kt}$ follows a possion distribution with a parameter 
$\lambda_{kt} = n_{kt}\theta_{kt}$, where $\theta_{kt}$ is the rate of property 
sales as a proportion of the total number of properties $n_{kt}$. The possion 
distribution is considered here as a property could be traded multiple times 
throughout years. As a result, $\theta_{kt}$ is not strictly the 
proportion of properties that sell in a year, but is on approximately the same
scale for interpretation purposes (Lee, Rushworth, Napier, 2018).  Hence,


$$Y_{kt} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{kt})$$.

Then, by looking at the log of $\lambda_{kt}$, 


$$ln(\lambda_{kt}) = \boldsymbol{x}_{kt}^{T}\beta + O_{kt} + \psi_{kt}$$


where $\boldsymbol{x}_{kt} = (x_{kt1}, \dots, x_{ktp})$ is a ${1 \times P}$ 
vector which represents p known covariates for unit $k$ and time period $t$, 
$\boldsymbol{O}_{t} = (O_{1t}, \dots, O_{Kt})$ denotes the ${1 \times K}$ 
column vector of offsets for time period $t$, and 
$\boldsymbol{\psi} = (\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{\psi}_{N})$, 
where $\boldsymbol{\psi}_{t} = ({\psi}_{1t}, \dots, {\psi}_{Kt})$. 
The $\psi_{kt}$ term is a latent component for area $k$ and time period $t$ 
encompassing one or more sets of spatio-temporally autocorrelated random effects.


Under the spatio-temporal random effects models, the spatial autocorrelation is 
controlled by the random effects in the neighborhood areas. A non-negative and 
symmetric ${K \times K}$ neighborhood matrix is defined to describe whether 
each pair of areas share one or more common vertex between boundaries nor not. 
Let's denote the neighborhood matrix as $\boldsymbol{W} = (w_{kj})$, where 
$w_{kj}$ denotes the spatial adjacency between area $i$ and $j$. If area $i$ 
and $j$ share a common border, $w_{kj} = 1$; and if area $i$ and $j$ are not 
spatially adjacent, then $w_{kj} = 0$.


Napier *et al.* (2016) proposed the following specification of the 
spatio-temporal structure for $\psi_{kt}$,

$$\psi_{kt} =  \phi_{kt} + \delta_t $$

$$\phi_kt |\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-kt},\boldsymbol{W} \sim N(\frac{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj}\phi_{jt}}{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 
- \rho_{S}}, \frac{\tau^2_{S}}{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 - \rho_{S}})$$


$$\delta_t |\boldsymbol{\delta}_{-t},\boldsymbol{D} \sim N(\frac{\rho_{T}\sum^N_{j=1}d_{tj}\delta_j}{\rho_{T}\sum^N_{j=1}d_{tj} + 1 - 
\rho_{T}}, \frac{\tau^2_{T}}{\rho_{T}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 - \rho_{T}})$$

$$\tau^2_{1}, {\dots} ,\tau^2_N, \tau^2_{T} \sim Inverse-Gamma(a, b)$$


$$\rho_{S} , \rho_{T} \sim Uniform(0,1)$$


where 
$\boldsymbol{\psi}_{-kt} = (\psi_{1t}, \dots, \psi_{k-1,t}, \psi_{k + 1,t},\dots, \psi_{Kt})$ 
and $\boldsymbol{\delta}_{-t} = (\delta_{1}, \dots, \delta_{t-1}, \delta_{t + 1}, \dots, \delta_{K})$. The model explain the overall spatio-temporal trend by a common 
temporal trend and a spatial variation term associated with each spatial unit.
CAR priors suggested by Leroux *et al.* (2000) are used here for the model.

## Explanatory Analysis

To start with, the duplicate observations from the primary dataset has been 
excluded.  The number of property sales is then calculated from the dataset.

Before fitting model, the spatio-temporal pattern of average sales rate can be 
examined by a heatmap, where the y-axis is the spatial stamp and x-axis is the
temporal index. Figure 1 is a heatmap shows the average sales rate for each
county from year 2001 to year 2016. It is obvious that the rates were higher 
for all counties for early 2000s, but they reached the minimum around 2007 
and 2008, when the financial crisis occurred.  It is also important to notice
that the rates are different for each county.  Hence, there are both a spatial 
and temporal pattern for the sales rate.  Moreover, the spatial-temporal pattern
for each county is not necessarily the same, and it seems that similarities
exist for close counties in consecutive time periods.


```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Heatmap showing that the spatial-temporal trend in the rate of property sales as a porportion of the total number of the propoerties between 2001 and 2016 "}
knitr::include_graphics("../report/heatmap_rate.png")
```

To include the spatio-temporal structure in the model, a neighborhood matrix
is created so that the areas which share a common border have entries of 1 and 
the areas that are not spatially adjacent get entries of 0. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Map of Connecticut Counties'}
load("../dat/w_neigh.RData")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))  
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sp))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps))
getLabelPoint <- # Returns a county-named list of label points
function(county) {Polygon(county[c('long', 'lat')])@labpt}

df <- map_data('county', 'connecticut')              
centroids <- by(df, df$subregion, getLabelPoint)     # Returns list
centroids <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)  # Convert to Data Frame
names(centroids) <- c('long', 'lat')                 # Appropriate Header

map('county', 'connecticut')
text(centroids$long, 
     centroids$lat, 
     paste(rownames(centroids), 
           rownames(W.neigh)), 
     offset=0, cex=0.7)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(W.neigh, col.names = row.names(W.neigh))
```



## Model and Findings

With the neighborhood matrix being constructed, the data can be fitted using 
`CARsepspatial()`, and the following code is used for fitting the model. The 
model uses 220,000 MCMC samples, and the first 20,000 of them are removed by 
the burn-in period. The samples are then thinned by 10 to reduce the 
autocorrelation of the Markov chain, resulting in 20,000 samples for inference
(Lee, *et al.*, 2018).  


```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = "", fig.align='center'}
test <- readLines("../R/analysis.R")
cat_lines <- function(pattern, file){
  pattern <- paste0("#--chunk-", pattern)
  id <- grep(pattern, file)
  id[1] <- id[1]+ 1L
  id[2] <- id[2]- 1L
  cat(file[id[1] : id[2]], sep = "\n")
}
cat_lines("fittedmodel", test)
```

The offset term renders the desired response variable,
$\theta_{kt}$, the rate of property sales. The estimated result can be 
interpreted as follows,

$$\theta_{kt} =  exp(\beta_{1} + \phi_{kt} + \delta_t) $$


which is the sum of an overall intercept term $\beta_1$, 
a space-time covariate $\phi_{kt}$ with a time period specific variance, 
and a region-wide temporal trend $\delta_t$ (Lee, *et al.*, 2018). The mean and 
standard deviation of $\theta_{kt}$ over space for each year is then plotted as 
follows, which displays the posterior median and spatial variation with 95% 
credible intervals for each quantity for each year.  A heatmap (Fig 3) is also 
created to plot all the posterior median sales rate $\theta_{kt}$.  


```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(c("../report/results_a.png", "../report/results_b.png"))
```


```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Posterior Median Sales Rate"}
knitr::include_graphics("../report/heatmap_posterior.png")
```


## Conclusion and Discussion

Based on the previous plots, the average sales rate started to 
drop since 2005 and has reached its minimum during the financial crisis. 
It also started to climb up recently, starting from 2011.  The spatial 
variations have similar trends, which suggests that the finical crisis 
negatively impacted the sales rate.  It is also important to notice that the 
heatmap show the a clear changing spatial pattern in sales rates over time. 
The spatial rates for 2001 to 2005 are largely consistent, but a clear 
change is evident between 2005 and 2008, which is coincident with the 
beginning of the global financial crisis. In 2013, the spatial pattern is 
different again.  Generally speaking, there is a spatio-temporal pattern 
existing in the calculated sales rates, which provides some insights about the 
CT housing market, and indirectly reflects the occurrence of some major economic 
events in Connecticut, such as global financial crisis in late 2000s. It might 
helpful to incorporate some covariates to understand and explain the underlying
patterns better.
