## Challenge Description

Goals:

- Identify and analyze the spatio-temporal trend for average CT housing sale 
rates over  years
    - estimate overall temporal trend
    - detect spatial variation over time


Proposed Method

- Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Hierarchical Model 
 


## Primary Data Set and Additional Data Set

The primary data set consists of individual sales records for each town in
CT from year 2001 to 2016

- Duplicate claims are removed
- Almost all the towns have 0 sales record in at least one year; in other
    words, there are missing values. No pattern or reason is detected for the
    missingness. Thus, missing completely at random is assumed here.
- Data is then aggregated by county and list year to get the sales numbers



Additional data set is used to compute the average sale rate for each county 
and each year.

- Annual Housing Inventory by Town from ct.gov
    - which has the housing inventory from 2000 to 2017 based
        on census 2000 and 2010 data
- The average sales rate for county in year is then calculated 
as $$\frac{\text{number of sale records}}{\text{number of properties}}$$


## Median Housing Price by Town

## Number of Sales by County

## Average Sales Rate

## Observations from the Plot

- Many missing values

- Rates were higher for all counties for early 2000s

- Rates reached their minimum around 2007 and 2008, when the financial 
crisis occurred

- Rates varied differently across counties

- Similarities existed for rates from close counties in consecutive time periods

## Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Hierarchical Model

- Bayesian Model is capable of modeling the spatio-temporal autocorrelation via
sets of autocorrelated random effects

-  Napier *et.al* (2016) proposed a model which renders a common temporal trend 
but varying spatial surfaces, which would be helpful to understand the 
spatio-temporal CT Housing sale rates.

- This method can be easily implemented in R using the package `CARBayesST`, a 
package for spatio-temporal areal unit modeling with conditional autoregressive 
priors

## Model Specification


$$\psi_{kt} =  \phi_{kt} + \delta_t $$

$$\phi_kt |\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-kt},\boldsymbol{W} \sim N(\frac{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj}\phi_j}{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 - \rho_{S}}, \frac{\tau^2_{S}}{\rho_{S}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 - \rho_{S}})$$


$$\delta_t |\boldsymbol{\delta}_{-t},\boldsymbol{D} \sim N(\frac{\rho_{T}\sum^N_{j=1}d_{tj}\delta_j}{\rho_{T}\sum^N_{j=1}d_{tj} + 1 - \rho_{T}}, \frac{\tau^2_{T}}{\rho_{T}\sum^K_{j=1}w_{kj} + 1 - \rho_{T}})$$

$$\tau^2_{1}, {\dots} ,\tau^2_N, \tau^2_{T} \sim Inverse-Gamma(a, b)$$


$$\rho_{S} , \rho_{T} \sim Uniform(0,1)$$






## Neighborhood Matrix

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("../dat/w_neigh.RData")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))  
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sp))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps))
getLabelPoint <- # Returns a county-named list of label points
function(county) {Polygon(county[c('long', 'lat')])@labpt}

df <- map_data('county', 'connecticut')              
centroids <- by(df, df$subregion, getLabelPoint)     # Returns list
centroids <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)  # Convert to Data Frame
names(centroids) <- c('long', 'lat')                 # Appropriate Header

map('county', 'connecticut')
text(centroids$long, 
     centroids$lat, 
     paste(rownames(centroids), 
           rownames(W.neigh)), 
     offset=0, cex=1)
```

## Neighborhood Matrix

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}

W.neigh
```



## Code 

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
test <- readLines("../R/analysis.R")
cat_lines <- function(pattern, file){
  pattern <- paste0("#--chunk-", pattern)
  id <- grep(pattern, file)
  id[1] <- id[1]+ 1L
  id[2] <- id[2]- 1L
  cat(file[id[1] : id[2]], sep = "\n")
}
cat_lines("fittedmodel", test)
```

## Quantifying the Spatial Variation (Stardard Deviation of $\theta_{kt}$ over space)

![](../report/results_b.png)

## Variations in Spatial Patterns

![](../report/heatmap_posterior.png)

## Summary and Next Steps

- Again, the previous picture (a) show that the average sales rate started to 
drop since 2005 and has reached its minimum during the financial crisis. 
It also starts to climb up recently

- (b) shows the spatial variations, which have similar trends

- Spatial patterns changed in 2005, 2008, and 2013

- Incorporate covariates could be helpful to understand the trends
